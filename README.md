# Smart Education Portal

This project was developed as a simple Node.js application. Education portal is an online course site. It is a web application where instructors can add and delete courses and students can enroll in courses. It was coded in accordance with the MVC structure. I used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, as a database and deployed my site using render.com.
